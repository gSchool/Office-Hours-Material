// Create a function that takes in an array of numbers, and returns 
// an object with 4 properties based on the input array:
//   an array of the even numbers
//   an array of the odd numbers
//   the sums of the even numbers
//   the sums of the odd numbers 

// Call the function with the numbers01 and numbers02 arrays below.
// Assign the output to a variable.
// Log the variable to the console.

// Write a function that takes in the object from the previous function
// and prints out the sums, count, and average of the even and odd numbers.
